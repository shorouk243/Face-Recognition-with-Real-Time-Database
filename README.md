## Introduction
Face recognition is a popular computer vision technique that involves identifying and verifying individuals based on their facial features. This project combines face recognition with a real-time database to create a system that can recognize and track faces in real-time.

The project leverages Firebase, a cloud-based platform, to store and manage the face data. By using Firebase's real-time database, the system can update and retrieve face information in real-time, making it suitable for applications that require dynamic face recognition capabilities.

## Features
- Real-time face recognition using a webcam or video feed
- Integration with Firebase for storing and retrieving face data
- Face tracking and identification in real-time
- User-friendly interface for configuring and managing face recognition settings

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Firebase SDK
- Face recognition library

You will also need an active Firebase account and project, as well as a webcam or video feed for capturing images.
